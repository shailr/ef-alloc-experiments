\begin{abstract}
\label{section_abstract}

Maximum Nash welfare (MNW) solution to the resource allocation problem has garnered attention for satisfying an illusive combination of efficiency and fairness properties in the form of Pareto Optimality (PO) and approximated envy-freeness (EF1) for indivisible goods with additive valuations \cite{caragiannis2016unreasonable}. Though, individually, each of those properties are easily achievable by maximizing the utilitarian vs egalitarian parameters of a welfare solution, a combination of them brings in a rare feat for MNW solution. Most of the existing research in this area are based on the assumption that the goods showcase additive valuations. But the real-world is hardly defined as such and is full of examples showing non-additive valuations of various forms. We extend the resource allocation problem with two forms of non-additive utilities; complementary and substitute. We simulate the MNW solutions with such dependent valuations. The experimental analysis show that the MNW solution satisfies the relaxed version of envy-freeness property along with the efficiency.  We show that MNW solution is both Pareto optimal and envy-free up to $k$ goods (EFk), where $k$ represents a maximum external dependency of valuation of the good.
